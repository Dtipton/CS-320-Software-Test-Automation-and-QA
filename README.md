How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure my code is functional and secure by writing effective unit and intergration test for all the individual parts of the program. This way I can ensure it catches any errors and prevent them from reaching production. This will ensure a quality and functional product.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By gathering requirements in simple and clear terms. This way they can be broken out further into stories for building in an agile enviroment.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach by reading out the requirements and splitting them into smaller chunks. From there I build out the invidiual parts and test to ensure they work before intergrating them together into a larger system. This way I can ensure quality and function in my code. I avoid any over complicated ways of building out functions if a more clear way is possible to help avoid tech debt and keep my code clean and readable.
